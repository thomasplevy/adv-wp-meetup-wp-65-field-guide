WP 6.5 Field Guide
------------------

A repository to accompany the PHX Advanced WordPress Meetup presentation on 2024-03-21.

This repo is an installable plugin which demonstrates features released in WP 6.5. It was created and tested against WP 6.5-rc3.

If it doesn't work for you, you can let me know but I can't promise I'll actually fix the problem. I wrote this in a hurry because I am a procrastinator so it probably has errors.

Many hearts <3.

## Interactivty API Demo

Find a demo of a block that utilizes the new interactivity API in the [popup](./popup/) directory.

Most of this code was generated by the `@wordpress/create-block` command and I basically just copied the code from [this demo](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-interactivity/#quick-start-guide) (and modified it slightly to be a bit cooler).

## Block Bindings API Demo

Find a demo of a custom block binding registry for use with the block bindings api in the [copyright](./copyright/) directory.

The code in this demo was copied from the [WP feature post](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/06/new-feature-the-block-bindings-api/) about this API with slight modifications.
